WordpressdataPump
=================

A PHP data pump for importing blog posts from another system into Wordpress via the the XML-RPC WordPress API.

This class requires the Wordpress [XMLRPC Client by Hieu Le](https://github.com/letrunghieu/wordpress-xmlrpc-client) as an interface.  It's easy to include it if you are using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Progress to here is merely a working class that abstracts away some of the nitty-gritty of preparing and importing data from another system into Wordrpress.  We have used this data pump to import hundreds of blogs posts in varying formats into Wordpress.
